Initial Setup (After Clone or Pull)

```bash
npm install               # Install JS dependencies

```



------



Native iOS Dev (Storyboard, Swift, etc.)

```
cd ios
xcodebuild clean          # Clean build cache (optional but safe)
open HarmonyTi.xcworkspace
```

> Then build/run from Xcode.



------



Run in Simulator via CLI

```
npx react-native run-ios
```

Or boot manually:

```
xcrun simctl list                     # See available devices
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15"        # Boot specific simulator
```



------

```



------



Link Native Modules / Assets

```
npx react-native link                # Only for manually linked packages

```
