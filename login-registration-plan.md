## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing a login/registration system with HubSpot integration and history export functionality for the mobile app.

## Requirements Analysis

### User Registration Fields

- Password (required)
- Name (required)
- Company name (required)
- Marketing preferences checkbox (optional)

### Authentication System
- Local authentication with secure storage

- Include user profile data and lookup history

### Call-to-Action Components
- Modal popup with "Send My Session" and "No, thanks" buttons
- Sidebar "Save Your Work" card with "Email Results" button
- Pre-populate email field if user is logged in

### Data Collection for Export

- Include relevant lookup details (HTS codes, countries, rates, etc.)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. User Interface Components

- Error handling
- User experience and navigation flow
- Integration with existing app components

## Next Steps
1. Design UI mockups for login and registration screens
2. Implement authentication logic
3. Create data collection and formatting utilities
4. Build call-to-action components
5. Integrate with existing app navigation
