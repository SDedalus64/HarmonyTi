Subject: RateCast App for Android - Test Version

Hey [Brother's name],

Here's the RateCast app I've been working on. I need you to test it on your Android phone.

IMPORTANT: This is a test version, not from the Google Play Store, so you'll need to follow special steps to install it.

I've attached:
1. The app file (RateCast.apk)
2. Step-by-step instructions (ANDROID_INSTALL_GUIDE.pdf)

Quick overview:
1. Download the APK file to your phone
2. You'll need to temporarily allow "Install from unknown sources"
3. Install the app
4. Turn the security setting back off
5. Open and test the app

The instructions explain everything in detail. It should take about 5-10 minutes.

What to test:
- Open the app and click around
- Try the tariff calculator (enter an HTS code like 86071930)
- Check if the Links page shows blog posts with images
- Let me know if anything crashes or looks weird

Text or call me if you get stuck!

Thanks,
[Your name]

P.S. The app file is about 50-100MB, so use WiFi if you're worried about data.
